# TTU-libraries

Some handy Python libraries to do various astro things...

===== freq_lib =====

Contains functions to do with frequency-domain analysis, i.e. generalised Lomb-Scargle periodograms, calculating normalisations for Fourier spectra, etc...

===== lc_lib =====

Contains the code for 'lightcurve' classes, to streamline analysing lightcurve data from a number of different instruments (i.e. TESS, RXTE...).  Contains functions to generate these objects from .FITS files.  Also contains a couple of handy time-series methods (e.g. a function to check whether two time ranges overlap)

===== pan_lib =====

The PANTHEON library from my time in Southampton, updated to the Python 3 era.  Mostly deprecated, but every now and again I fancy using something that I remember exists in here, so good to keep around.  Contains a LOT of stuff, but its quite extensively documented.
